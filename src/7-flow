The Lighthouse of Alexandria (or the Pharos of Alexandria, Greek: ὁ Φάρος τῆς
Ἀλεξανδρείας) was a tower built in the 3rd century BC (between 285 and 247 BC)
on the island of Pharos in Alexandria, Egypt, to serve as that port's landmark,
and later, its lighthouse. [...] It may have been the world's third tallest
building after the two Great Pyramids (of Khufu and Khafra) for its entire
life. [...] There are ancient claims the light from the lighthouse could be
seen from up to 35 miles (56 km) away. Unconfirmed legends claim the light from
Pharos could burn enemy ships before they reached shore. [...] The two
earthquakes in 1303 and 1323 damaged the lighthouse to the extent that the Arab
traveler Ibn Battuta reported no longer being able to enter the ruin. Even the
stubby remnant disappeared in 1480, when the then-Sultan of Egypt, Qaitbay,
built a medieval fort on the former location of the building using some of the
fallen stone.
