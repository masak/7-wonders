The Statue of Zeus at Olympia was made by the Greek sculptor Phidias, circa 432
BC on the site where it was erected in the Temple of Zeus, Olympia, Greece.
[...] The seated statue, some 12 meters (39 feet) tall, occupied the whole
width of the aisle of the temple built to house it. "It seems that if Zeus were
to stand up," the geographer Strabo noted early in the first century BC, "he
would unroof the temple." [...] The circumstances of its eventual destruction
are a source of debate: the eleventh-century Byzantine historian Georgios
Kedrenos recorded the tradition that it was carried off to Constantinople,
where it was destroyed in the great fire of the Lauseion, in AD 475. Others
argue that it perished with the temple when it burned in 425.
