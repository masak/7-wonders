=for history
The Colossus of Rhodes was a statue of the Greek god Helios, erected in the
city of Rhodes on the Greek island of Rhodes by Chares of Lindos between 292
and 280 BC. [...] Before its destruction, the Colossus of Rhodes stood over 30
meters (107 ft) high, making it one of the tallest statues of the ancient
world. [...] The statue stood for only 56 years until Rhodes was hit by the 226
BC Rhodes earthquake, when significant damage was also done to large portions
of the city, including the harbor and commercial buildings, which were
destroyed. The statue snapped at the knees and fell over on to the land.
Ptolemy III offered to pay for the reconstruction of the statue, but the oracle
of Delphi made the Rhodians afraid that they had offended Helios, and they
declined to rebuild it.
