The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, Mausoleum of Mausolus or Tomb of Mausolus (in
Greek, Μαυσωλεῖον της Ἁλικαρνασσοῦ) was a tomb built between 353 and 350 BC at
Halicarnassus (present Bodrum, Turkey) for Mausolus, a satrap in the Persian
Empire, and Artemisia II of Caria, his wife and sister. [...] The word
mausoleum has since come to be used generically for any grand tomb, though
"I<Mausoleion>" originally meant "I<[building] dedicated to Mausolus>". [...]
The Mausoleum overlooked the city of Halicarnassus for many years. It was
untouched when the city fell to Alexander III of Macedon in 334 BC and still
undamaged after attacks by pirates in 62 and 58 BC. It stood above the city's
ruins for sixteen centuries. Then a series of earthquakes shattered the columns
and sent the bronze chariot crashing to the ground. By 1404 AD only the very
base of the Mausoleum was still recognizable.
