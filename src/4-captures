The Temple of Artemis (Greek: Ἀρτεμίσιον Artemision), also known less precisely
as Temple of Diana, was a Greek temple dedicated to Artemis completed— in its
most famous phase— around 550 BC at Ephesus (in present-day Turkey). Though the
monument was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, only foundations
and sculptural fragments of the temple remain. There were previous temples on
its site, where evidence of a sanctuary dates as early as the Bronze Age. The
whole temple was made of marble except for the roof. [...] In the seventh
century, a flood destroyed the temple, depositing over half a meter of sand
and scattering flotsam over the former floor of hard-packed clay.
